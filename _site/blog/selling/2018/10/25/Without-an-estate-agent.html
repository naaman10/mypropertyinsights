            <p><p>Having headaches over estate agent fees?</p>

<p>Ever thought of selling without an estate agent? Estimated on a £300,000 property, sellers hand
over 1.8 per cent to an agent who provide only a valuation, photographs, <!--more--> listing in branch and
online and organising the sale. That works out at £5,400 you are handing over!</p>

<p>Here with Property Insights, we show you 10 steps to selling your house without spending a
fortune.</p>

<h3 id="1-property-presentation">1. Property presentation</h3>
<p>You want your home to stand out from the crowd and be as sellable as possible. Pick up ideas
from interior magazines or simply follow these mini steps:
Entrance is key - Your front door is the centre piece of your kerb appeal so repaint it in a
tasteful colour. Update the outside lights and add potted plants around your entrance.
Remove any clutter! We can not say this enough! Some buyers struggle with imagination
and if they see you struggle with space, then they will too! Either use packing boxes or 	 	
have a good old clear out!
Clean and fragrant - buyers need to imagine themselves in “your” space, so no last night’s
take away or left over pots in the sink! Buyers expect an immaculate home.</p>
<h3 id="2-set-a-price">2. Set a price</h3>
<p>Now your house is looking its best it’s time to set a price. Working out a realistic price will help
with the speed of the sale. You should start with researching and evaluating nearby comparable
properties to give you the best idea. Companies such as zoopla.co.uk/house-prices can assist
you by searching your postcode to show previous sold properties in the UK.</p>
<h3 id="3-write-a-description">3. Write a description</h3>
<p>Keep it punctual and precise. Nobody wants to read a description on their dream home and all
that stands out is the grammar. Let the photographs and floor plan tell the story and keep the
words to a minimum.</p>
<h3 id="4-take-photos-and-make-a-floorplan">4. Take photos and make a floorplan</h3>
<p>Quality pictures are a necessity. Similar to the description, if the photos are of low quality, so will your property. Perhaps consider investing in a good camera or ask around to borrow one. This could be paramount to your online traffic. You will need to prepare accurate floorplans to provide appropriate details of the sizes of each room. Online tools such as PlanUp.co.uk will draw a one-off plan for £1.99, or iPhone users can download apps such as Floor Plan for free, they work out your measurements and you can download the floorplan for a £2.99 fee.</p>
<h3 id="5-advertising-and-where-you-can-list-the-property">5. Advertising and where you can list the property</h3>
<p>Most websites we found who advertise property, don’t advertise properties sold privately, for this you need to pay for a online agent. To buy these, most offer a one-off fee of £99 which is the most basic plan. Alternatively, other sites such as HouseWeb.co.uk can charge £195 a year to list onto sites such as Rightmove and Zoopla, can upload 20 photos and offer social media sharing. If you have a good following on social media, you could promote your property yourself.</p>
<h3 id="6-arrange-viewings">6. Arrange viewings</h3>
<p>You know your house better than any agent - so why shouldn’t you be the one showing buyers around? If you live on your own and are worried about safety, simply ask a friend to join you. Or if you are worried you work in the daytime and are unavailable, ask a trusted family member or friend on your behalf? What are friends for anyway?</p>
<h3 id="7-negotiate-the-price">7. Negotiate the price</h3>
<p>Calculate before hand how much you are willing to accept. This is a provisional price due to unforeseen extras you may not have thought of. Do not go below the lowest figure you had planned for - regardless of how nervous you may be or how desperate. This is where you could be knocking off thousands of pounds just out of sheer spontaneity. Keep communications friendly as you never know the buyer may want to approach you again if they decide to increase their offer.</p>
<h3 id="8-accept-an-offer">8. Accept an offer</h3>
<p>Accept verbally initially, and then follow up via email to have in writing. Ask to see proof of ID and any mortgage offer applicable or a bank statement if they are also agent-free. A copy of a mortgage valuation/survey is a must and so serious buyers will be open to arranging this within in a couple of days so secure this promptly.</p>
<h3 id="9-hire-a-solicitor-or-conveyancer">9. Hire a solicitor or conveyancer</h3>
<p>Word of mouth here usually works out most successful. Ask around if any family or friends have used a licensed conveyancers before as these tend to be cheaper than solicitors and you can never go wrong with a recommendation. To search for conveyancers in your area, visit the Council online (clc.uk.org).</p>
<h3 id="10-deal-with-renegotiations">10. Deal with renegotiations</h3>
<p>Congratulations, you are nearly there with selling your home! Once the buyer’s survey has been completed, don’t be surprised if they try to renegotiate the price. If they find something wrong with the property, they may think the original agreed price may not be fair now. Simply ask to see the survey and check if it is a genuine problem. If there does seem to be a problem, you have a few options; to sort the repairs yourself and keep at the agreed price, stand your ground completely where they have to pay the agreed price and sort the repairs or lastly you knock down the price and let the new buyers sort the problem.</p>
